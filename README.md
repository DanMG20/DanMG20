Aerospace engineer by day, closet programmer by night.

I've always had a deep curiosity about how things work—that's what led me to study engineering. But in my free time, I discovered a new passion: programming. I started coding as a hobby, writing simple scripts, and eventually began building my own projects in Python — from small automation tools to data analysis and visualizations.
